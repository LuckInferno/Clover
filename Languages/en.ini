[OptionExplanations]
ReceptorSize = Scale the size of the receptors and notes. This will also indirectly scale your scrolling speed.
CustomizeGameplay= While active, allows you to reposition and resize elements on the gameplay screen to your liking. Any changes will persist through version updates.
LaneCover=Enable lane cover which will cover a portion of the notefield. The height can be adjusted by holding down <Select>+<EffectUp/Down>
StaticBG = Toggle whether or not to allow the background to change.
CBHighlight=Highlights the lane where a combo breaking judgment has occured.
JudgmentText=Toggle whether or not to show the Judgment.
JudgmentAnimations=Toggle judgment animations.
ComboText=Toggle whether or not to show the combo.

TargetGoal = Set the percentage goal for the target tracker.
TargetTrackerMode = Toggle tracker mode between a set percentage and your personal best. If no PB is available it will default to your set target goal.
JudgeCounter = Enable Judge Counter. Displays your currently obtained judgment counts. This has a moderate impact on performance. Expect about a 10% penalty to average fps.

ErrorBarLoc = Set the positioning of the error bar to center or bottom.
PlayerInfo = Enable the player info display in the bottom left. This is the most taxing gameplay screen element. Expect a 20% or higher drop in average fps. It's also useless for non-streamers. Advised to disable.
Leaderboard = Displays the top 4 global scores against your current one
FullProgressBar = Displays your progress through the song as well as song title.
MiniProgressBar = Display a smaller, less intrusive, more accessible version of the progress bar placed above the combo text.
